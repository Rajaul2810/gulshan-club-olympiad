## 🎯 How It Works

### URL Structure:
```
Sport Name → URL Slug
"Football Men (7 a Side)" → /sports/football-men-7-a-side
"Basketball Men's" → /sports/basketball-mens
"Cricket (T-10)" → /sports/cricket-t-10
```

### Data Filtering:
```typescript
// Fixtures: Filter by sport name
sportFixtures = fixtures.filter(f => 
  f.sport === "Football Men (7 a Side)"
);

// Media: Filter by sport name and type
photos = media.filter(m => 
  m.sport === "Football Men (7 a Side)" && 
  m.type === 'photo'
);

videos = media.filter(m => 
  m.sport === "Football Men (7 a Side)" && 
  m.type === 'video'
);

// Results: Filter by fixture's sport
results = results.filter(r => 
  r.fixture.sport === "Football Men (7 a Side)"
);
```

### Real-Time Updates:
```
Admin adds data → Supabase broadcasts → 
Hook receives update → Page re-renders → 
Data appears instantly (no refresh!)
```

## ⚙️ Sport Name Matching

**CRITICAL:** Sport names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)

### In Admin Dropdowns:
```
✅ CORRECT: "Football Men (7 a Side)"
❌ WRONG: "football men (7 a side)"
❌ WRONG: "Football Men 7 a Side"
❌ WRONG: "Football"
```

### How to Ensure Match:
1. Always use sport dropdown in admin
2. Don't manually type sport names
3. Dropdowns show exact sports from `SportsCategory.tsx`

---

## 📁 File Changes Made

### Updated Files:
1. ✅ `src/app/sports/[slug]/page.tsx` - Now uses real Supabase data
2. ✅ `next.config.ts` - Added YouTube thumbnail domain

### No Changes Needed:
- ❌ Hooks (already created)
- ❌ Database (already setup)
- ❌ Components (already exist)
