# Supabase Integration - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema**
Located in: `src/lib/supabase/schema.sql`

**Tables Created:**
- `clubs` - Store all participating clubs

**Features:**
- UUID primary keys
- Foreign key relationships
- Automatic timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Indexes for performance
- Trigger functions for auto-updating timestamps

### 2. **Supabase Client & Utilities**

**Functions:**
- `supabase` - Main Supabase client
- `uploadFile()` - Upload files to storage with error handling
- `deleteFile()` - Delete files from storage

### 3. **TypeScript Types**
Located in: `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts`

Complete type definitions for all database tables and operations.

### 4. **Custom React Hooks**
Real-time data hooks with automatic subscriptions:

#### `useClubs` (`src/hooks/useClubs.ts`)
- Fetch all clubs
- Real-time updates when clubs change

- **Auto-update fixture status to 'completed'** when result added
- Real-time updates
- CRUD operations

### 5. **UI Components**

#### Loading States (`src/components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx`)
- `LoadingSpinner` - Animated spinner (sm, md, lg sizes)
- `LoadingOverlay` - Full overlay with message

#### Messages (`src/components/ui/ErrorMessage.tsx`)
- `ErrorMessage` - Error display with retry option
- `SuccessMessage` - Success confirmation

### 6. **Admin Pages with Full Integration**

3. Logo uploads to Supabase Storage
4. Club data saves to database
5. **List updates automatically** (no refresh)
6. Success message shows

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Step 2: Create Supabase Project
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create new project
3. Wait for database initialization

### Step 3: Run SQL Schema
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy entire content from `src/lib/supabase/schema.sql`
3. Paste and execute

### Step 4: Create Storage Buckets
1. Go to Storage in dashboard
2. Create bucket: `club-logos` (public)
3. Create bucket: `media-photos` (public)

### Step 5: Configure Storage Policies
For each bucket, add these policies:

**SELECT (Read):**
```sql
true
```

**INSERT:**
```sql
true
```

**UPDATE:**
```sql
true
```

**DELETE:**
```sql
true
```

### Step 6: Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

Get values from: Project Settings → API

### Step 7: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Database Relationships
```
clubs (id) ←→ fixtures (team1_id, team2_id)
fixtures (id) ←→ results (fixture_id)
results (winner_id) → clubs (id)
```

### Storage Buckets
```
