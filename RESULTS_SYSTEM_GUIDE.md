## 💾 Database Schema

### Results Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  fixture_id UUID REFERENCES fixtures(id),
  team1_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  team2_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  winner_id UUID REFERENCES clubs(id),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(fixture_id)  -- One result per fixture
);
```

### Key Points:
- **fixture_id** - Links to fixtures table
- **winner_id** - NULL if draw, otherwise club ID
- **UNIQUE(fixture_id)** - Prevents duplicate results
- **Cascade delete** - Deleting fixture deletes result

---

### When Result Added:

```
1. User clicks "Add Result"
2. Form validates input
3. Data sent to Supabase
4. Result inserted in database
5. Fixture status updated to "completed"
6. Supabase broadcasts change
7. useResults hook receives update
8. UI updates automatically
